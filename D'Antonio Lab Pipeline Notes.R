# goals for week 1
    # read in datasheets
    # create outline of shiny app

    # outline for shiny app
      # for biomass: can choose which location to look at, or compare avg. values between species
          # max, min, range, mean, median, sd., histogram
          # correlation b/w location and mass
      # for branches: can choose which species/transect to look at, or compare avg. values between species/transects
          # max, min, range, mean, median, sd., histogram
          # correlations b/w transect/species/branch length/ramification
      # for leaf traits: can choose which species/transect to look at, or compare avg. values between species/transect
          # max, min, range, mean, median, sd., histogram
          # correlations b/w transect/species/leaf curling/leaf thickness/mass

# questions for week 1 meeting
  # are all of the data going to be similar enough where they can use the same sorts of visualization?
  # or should we just include a bunch of visualization options?
  # what does "ramification" in the branches .csv refer to?
